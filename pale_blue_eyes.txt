Not an extraordinary detective, but a really solid one.

The good; director Scott Cooper is a craftsman at building up suspense. In many scenes where seemingly nothing much happens, there is still that AIR OF EERY SUSPENSE. That feeling under my skin that something is about to happen, or that something is mysterious, that feeling permeates throughout this entire, mesmirizing story.

More good: Christian Bale, Christian Bale, Christian Bale. One of my favorite actors and he has got the gift of method acting. He becomes the part. He is the part. And he is such a joy to watch him perform this role in such a way that it mesmirized from start till finish.

Any bad? This movie starts out slow, but the tension and suspense build up until the very end. So have some patience and you will be rewarded by a solidly made detective.
